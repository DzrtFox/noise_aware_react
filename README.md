To run the project:
1. Pull down the repository
2. Ensure Node v10 or higher is installed
3. Navigate to the project directory > npm install
4. To run the app: npm start


Tools used:
- create-react-app (https://create-react-app.dev/) to create the project skeleton
- React (https://reactjs.org/) to build the UI
- RefluxJS (https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) for state management
- Reactstrap (https://reactstrap.github.io/) for UI styling
- axios (https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for API calls


NOTES:
- I wanted to do this app in Vue but to save time, I went with React since I am more familiar with it
- There may be some boilerplate code/files from create-react-app that I didn't have time to clean up
- To keep things simple, I didn't add any error handling to the app
- The app has very minimal styling (ie it ain't pretty, but it works...) :)
